# Portfolio Starter (LTR, English)

This is a minimal responsive portfolio template without external frameworks.
You can deploy it easily on **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, or any static host.

## Quick Edit
- Open `index.html` and change "Your Name", text, and links.
- In the projects section, copy/remove cards as needed.
- Replace `assets/placeholder.png` with your own project images.
- If you have a CV, place `cv.pdf` in the root directory.

## Publish on GitHub Pages (no command line)
1. Create a new repository (e.g., `username.github.io`).
2. Upload all files from this zip.
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and deploy from branch `main`, folder `/root`.
4. Your site will be live at `https://USERNAME.github.io`
